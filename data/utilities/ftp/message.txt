Hello Mr/Mrs:
    
    I was able to talk to their printer share administrator of the company in a pub. he was 6 feet tall 
    with a long hair wearing a black hoodie which has a printed text of "ch3c00h sheizsjddcqp". He told that
    their services share password and username are in this service . As he seems nerdy he has given somesort
    cryptographic text 6314b5b113d8c149d79aa42360ee31e4 and after several talks , I offered him 4 drinks
    but he didn't leak any further info . So I was totally disappointed and left the pub . As you have more
    computer knowledge than me , try to get the credential for the next service . 
                                                                            
                                                                            - th3h04x
