Hello Mr/Mrs:
    
    I was able to talk to their printer share administrator of the company in a pub. he was 6 feet tall 
    with a long hair wearing a black hoodie which has a printed text of "ch3c00h sheizsjddcqpnodv". He told that
    their services share password and username are in this service . As he seems nerdy he has given somesort
    cryptographic text [5c86511993d156bb079996d6abbe5aa83698602d321e37c49324915074002ae7a1af7c2909f1d840ad47b
    db3b8cacd419f6b3ba889c58725c1d14e93453ed473] and after several talks , I offered him 4 drinks
    but he didn't leak any further info . So I was totally disappointed and left the pub . As you have more
    computer knowledge than me , try to get the credential for the next service . 
                                                                            
                                                                            - th3h04x
