Hello Mr/Mrs ,

    Wow , I'm so excited that you have reached this level . Now I understand that you are a very 
    nerdy person . But as we move on , the exploits will get harder and harder . So put on your
    black hat and exploit the upcoming services .As our id card numbers are blocked because we
    were fired from the company , we need the id card numbers of other employees . As both of us are
    an introvert , we dont have any friends in the company , we are now unable to login into the employee
    portal of the company . So I try to tamper the call of an employee to the company system administrator. 
    They talked about starting a startup based on food industry which includes food items which are long
    losting to get more profit . They also discussed about the authentication mechanisms which are used in 
    the company website .

                                                                    - th3h04x
