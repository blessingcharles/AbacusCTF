To Mr.Droopy.

        Hey Mr.Droopy, you seems so frustrated because you have been fired by your company for no reasons. I also felt the same last year .  So I have tried to hack into their systems , but i was unable to do it . But I think you are more intelligent than me . So I left my footprints in several services  of the company which I was able to gather while try to attack their services. The company leaves their credentials of each of their services inorder of process endpoints .I spent one year try to use social engineering and gather several information from various managers and sys admins . I'll give you information about each service when you got access to it . So try to exploit in order to get access to each processes of the server . I'll payback you with money if you hack their server and spoil their business .You may think you don't have any prior knowledge of hacking a server . To boost your confidence I'll give you a two question basic question , solve the first two easy question and get back into real hacking of the company .  Happy revenge !
