Hello Mr/Mrs.

    Hey , you seems so frustrated because you have been fired by your company for no reasons. I also felt 
    the same last year . So I have tried to hack into their systems , but i was unable to do it . But I
    think you are more intelligent than me . So I leave my footprints in several services  of the company
    which I was able to gather while try to attack their services. The company leaves their credentials of
    each of their services inorder of process endpoints .I spent one year try to use social engineering and 
    gather several information from various managers and sys admins . I'll give you information about each 
    service when you got access to it . So try to exploit in order to get access to each processes of the 
    server .

                                                                    - th3h04x
